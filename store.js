Seventy percent of deaths are of children under five. It is the worldâ€™s largest killer of pregnant women, one of the leading causes of child deaths in Africa and a major obstacle to social and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of malaria deaths occur. Since its founding in 2004, AMF has raised over $139 million â€“ enough to purchase and distribute 53 million nets to protect 99 million people. To date, AMF has distributed or is in the process of distributing over 28 million nets and <a href='https://www.againstmalaria.com/futuredistributions.aspx' target='_blank'>assessing distributions</a> of 25 million more.",

    "organization" : "Development Media International (DMI) uses radio and television to encourage healthy behaviors that save lives and reduce suffering in the world's poorest countries. <br/><br/> DMI's campaigns encourage people to take action against common causes of death like malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia with simple interventions such as washing hands, giving birth in health facilities, exclusively breast-feeding and making use of readily-available treatments for pneumonia and diarrhea. They also promote healthy lifestyle choices around topics such as family planning, HIV/AIDS and sanitation. One type of campaign involves realistic and sometimes humorous broadcasts written and performed by locals, followed by lively call-in discussions. DMI uses mass media because they believe it can break through cultural and generational norms and  is extremely cost-effective: broadcasting a radio message about regular hand-washing is a cheap way to reach thousands of people and encourage them to adopt this simple life-saving behavior.

GAIN runs a variety of programs to support fortification of staple foods to increase global health; the program targeted by The Life You Can Save and by GiveWell is GAIN's Universal Salt Iodization (USI) Program. <br/><br/> Iodine is a micronutrient crucial for bone and brain development. Deficiency of iodine is the worldâ€™s most prevalent cause of preventable brain damage. It can also cause goiter, cretinism, stunting, increased infant mortality, miscarriage and stillbirth. It more deeply entrenches individuals, families and countries in a downward spiral of extreme poverty. <br/><br/> In many countries, sufficient iodine intake is rarely achievable due to a variety of factors including food shortages, limited food diversity, poor soil, and lack of sufficient iodization in staple foods and salt. As a result, iodine deficiency is still prevalent in much of the developing world. An estimated 1.75 billion people, including 25% of households in the developing world, are at risk of iodine deficiency and its serious health complications.  A highly cost-effective way to address this problem is through salt iodization. <br/><br/> GAIN helps salt producers around the globe build their capacity to iodize properly, and helps set up more cost-effective procurement and distribution mechanisms, resulting in reduced iodine prices and better access. GAIN works with governments to build sustainable monitoring and evaluation systems. GAINâ€™s activities include advocacy, technical assistance, supplying equipment, and training. This multi-faceted approach is designed to ensure iodization programs in high-burden countries grow and last far beyond GAINâ€™s involvement, bringing efforts closer to optimal global iodine nutrition.",

Yet most of these farmers live in remote areas where they lack access to basic agricultural supplies and training. Many cannot manage to grow enough food to feed their families, much less make a profit to allow for necessities year-round. A yearly â€œhunger seasonâ€ is commonplace. As populations grow, the problem is exacerbated.<br /><br />One Acre Fund has developed a service bundle that enables smallholder farmers to significantly increase farm production as well as income, with the potential to grow their way out of hunger and extreme poverty. The bundle includes naturally improved hybrid seeds and fertilizer, financing for farm inputs, agricultural training, and market facilitation to maximize profits. Farmers are taught sustainable practices to minimize harvest loss with proper storage techniques and maximize profits from harvest sales. The organization continually updates its services based on farmer feedback. One Acre Fund also creates career opportunities, as many of those on One Acre Fundâ€™s staff began as client farmers.",

    "numbers" : "One Acre Fund served more than 500,000 farm families in East Africa in 2017.  They are on track to reach 1 million farm households by 2020.  In 2016, program participant farmers saw an average increase of <a href='https://www.oneacrefund.org/results/impact' target='_blank'>$100 in additional profits</a>, representing a 50% gain in farm income from supported activities. The core program is growing in large part due to One Acre Fundâ€™s revenue model, in which farmers are given a loan of about $75 (including a ~17% interest/service fee) to cover most of the cost of their â€œfull service bundleâ€ including seed, fertilizer, and training. Farmers repay their loans as income is made during or after harvest. In 2016,  <a href='https://www.oneacrefund.org/results/impact' target='_blank'>98%</a> of farmers will repaid their loans, covering <a href='https://www.oneacrefund.org/results/impact#sec-968_441_6_5' target='_blank'>73%</a> of field program costs. Donations and grants are needed to fill the remaining gap between field revenues and field expenses of roughly $33 per farmer (including overhead).<br><br>The organizationâ€™s impact on farmer profits is calculated by comparing the profits of One Acre Fund clients to highly similar comparison group farmers. Because One Acre Fund is unable to capture reliable profit data from economic activities outside their program, they measure profit impact only on supported activities. Supported activities include farming of crops supported by One Acre Fund (subsistence crops like maize, beans, and millet, but not cash crops like tobacco and sugar). Supported activities also include non-farm â€œadd-onâ€ products (details below).

They are part of a group called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) which affect the poorest and most marginalised communities in the world, placing a heavy burden on over 1 billion people. The World Health Organization estimates that <a href='http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/schistosomiasis/en/'>206 million</a> people have schistosomiasis and <a href='http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en/'>1.5 billion</a> have STH. These infections can result in anemia, stunted growth, reduced school attendance, impaired cognitive development, reduced worker productivity and internal organ damage. NTDs impact life expectancy, education and economic opportunities, costing developing economies billions of dollars each year.<br><br>Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) at Imperial College London works with governments across sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen to evaluate and support mass school-based deworming programs, which have a strong track record of success. These programs provide school children with pills that protect against the most prevalent NTDs.",
